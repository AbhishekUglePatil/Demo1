            HTML is easy to learn - You will enjoy it!
            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
            in a web browser.
            It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
            JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages.
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of
            the document.
